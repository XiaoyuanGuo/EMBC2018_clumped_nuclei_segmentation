### Table of Content

-[Dataset] ( Image patches used for test )

        * ( Image patches: 20, random size, 1024*1376 pixels )

-[Usage] (How to run the code)

 * First clone the repository and execute **/Code/Nuclei_Seg.m** file.
 *  Prerequsites: Matlab2017a
 * **Nuclei_Seg.m** reads an image and some predefined parameters to segment clumped  nuclei and plot the connecting lines on the original images.
